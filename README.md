# Arduino sketches

Now that a few years of working with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) have
flown by, it is time to get organized.
As I learn and try new techniques, I will gather working examples in the
[**techniques**](techniques) folder to use as building blocks for future
projects.
Similarly, my various projects live in the [**projects**](projects) folder.
Of course I have not done this consistently from the beginning, but what is
life for if not self improvement?

Most of my work so far has involved LEDs and signal processing for sound
reactivity. I am indebted to [Burning Man 2013] for opening my eyes to the
accessibility of working with electronics to make art and to [Adafruit] for
some great tutorials that helped unleash the monster and drain my bank account.

## Projects

The below animations link to their code.
The projects evolve, but I will try to create new ones if they diverge too much
from the images.
See the [**projects**](projects) folder for the complete list.
Sometimes I also write about and post videos of these projects on my [blog].
